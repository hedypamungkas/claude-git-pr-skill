## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- **Initial release** of github-pr-review skill
- **Pending review workflow** - Always creates pending reviews before submitting

- **Event type selection** - Smart decision making between APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/COMMENT
- **Correct gh api syntax** - Single quotes around `comments[][]` parameters, -f/-F flag usage

- **Real-world impact section** - Explains benefits vs drawbacks
- **Plugin marketplace support** - Can be installed via `/plugin install github-pr-review`
- **TDD-tested** - Created using Test-Driven Development for skills methodology

### Features
- 4-step workflow: Draft → Show → Approve → Post
- Shows file path, line number, comment text, code suggestions, and event type before posting
- Prevents posting immediately under time pressure
- Enforces consistent workflow regardless of urgency
- Batches multiple comments into one PR notification

### Documentation
- Complete README with installation instructions
- Plugin marketplace integration
- Team-wide deployment examples

- TDD process documentation

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- **gh CLI detection** - Checks if gh is installed before attempting review workflow
- **Installation instructions** - Provides link to https://cli.github.com/ if gh not found
- **Prerequisites section** - Clear guidance on required tools before starting
- **Authentication reminder** - Instructions to run `gh auth login` after installing
- **New red flags** - Warns against skipping gh detection step

### Changed
- **Core workflow** - Now includes gh CLI check as first required step (5 steps instead of 4)
- **Error handling** - Stops immediately if gh not installed instead of failing later

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-02

### Changed
- **Clarified `side` parameter usage** - Updated documentation to explain `RIGHT` vs `LEFT` (added/modified vs deleted lines)
- **Added nested backticks documentation** - Documented how to handle code suggestions in markdown files with triple backticks

### Fixed
- **Nested backticks syntax** - Fixed markdown rendering issue in code example (5 backticks for outer block)

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Critical API parameter errors** - Fixed HTTP 422 errors caused by incorrect API parameters:
  - Removed invalid `side` parameter from draft review comments (not supported by DraftPullRequestReviewComment)
  - Changed `comments[][line]` to `comments[][position]` (GitHub API requires diff position, not line number)
  - Added required API headers: `-H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json"` and `-H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"`
- **Null body values** - Added documentation to ensure all comment bodies are non-empty

### Changed
- **Added "Understanding Position vs Line Number" section** - Explains what position is and how to calculate it from diff hunks
- **Updated all API examples** - Now use `position` instead of `line`, removed `side` parameter, added headers
- **Updated Common Mistakes table** - Added new entries for line vs position, side parameter, null bodies, missing headers
- **Updated Red Flags** - Added warnings against using `line` instead of `position` and adding `side=RIGHT`

### Added
- **Position calculation guide** - Three options for getting position values (diff output, gh pr view, estimation)
- **Diff hunk explanation** - Visual example showing how to count position from @@ headers

### Planned
- Multi-line code suggestion examples
- Additional event type scenarios
- Integration with PR templates
- Support for review threads and conversations
