### validate-position.sh (NEW in v2.1.0)

Validate a single position in a file's diff. This is useful when you want to check if a specific position is valid before posting.

```

**Example:**
```bash
./commands/validate-position.sh 6 app/root.tsx 5
```

     gh pr diff 6 -- app/root.tsx
```

### post-review.sh (NEW in v2.1.0)

./commands/post-review.sh <pr_number> <json_file> [dry_run]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Post the review
./commands/post-review.sh 6 /tmp/review.json

# Dry run to test without posting
./commands/post-review.sh 6 /tmp/review.json dry_run
```

**Features:**
- Validates JSON before posting
- Shows review summary with comment details
- Confirms before posting
- Provides helpful error messages for common issues
- Supports dry-run mode for testing
